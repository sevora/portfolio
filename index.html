                    Enough about me for now: I think I just met someone else who is as focused as me when it comes to their passion.

                <p>
                    Doing coding challenges and following along tutorials with great explanation. I do and do. I ask and ask. Until

                    It's not simply because it's a better use of time. Rather, games bore me, and so do gossip.
                    I ended up learning on my own, every single day I could. Obsessing over some logic problem until I can't
                    think right anymore.
