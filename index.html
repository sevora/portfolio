                <p class="no-margin" >
                    I love problem-solving, mysteries, and challenges.
                    It seems to me that there is really no role model in life, everyone has their own faults. But whenever I see the bad
                    in a person, I end up promising myself that I'll be better than them until I'm the best. Only the strongest can 
                    stay true to their principles.

                <p>
                    They're not a lot and they can be <i>weird</i>. But being weird isn't that bad. 
                    They can be more impressive than normies. In fact, time with them 
                    is enjoyable with all the ridiculous ideas and imagination that
                    would bring anyone back to the feelings of wonder a child has.

                    It's not simply because it's a better use of time. Rather, games bore me, and so do gossip.
                    I ended up learning on my own, every single day I could. Obsessing over some logic problem until I can't
                    think right anymore.
