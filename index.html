                    They're not a lot and they can be <i>weird</i>. But being weird isn't that bad. 
                    They can be more impressive than normies. In fact, time with them 
                    is enjoyable with all the ridiculous ideas and imagination that
                    would bring anyone back to the feelings of wonder a child has.

                    Doing coding challenges and following along tutorials with great explanation. I do and do. I ask and ask. Until

                    It's not simply because it's a better use of time. Rather, games bore me, and so do gossip.
                    I ended up learning on my own, every single day I could. Obsessing over some logic problem until I can't
                    think right anymore.
