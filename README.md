This is the portfolio website of Sevora ([@ralphlouisgopez](https://twitter.com/ralphlouisgopez)) made from pure code. The source code is written in ES6 thus a webpack transpiler was set up in order to maximize compatibility.

- `npm install --dev` - to install all the dependencies for the transpiler setup. 
- `npm run build` - to transpile the source code inside the js directory and save results to assets bundle folder.
